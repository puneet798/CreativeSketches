alt = "Sensing Geometry"
description = "An interactive sketch to play sonically with circles, tangents to those circles and angles between them. From any point outside the circle of a given radius r, one can always draw two tangents from that point to the given circle. This sketch explores the relationship between the angle of those two tangents from various such points. The attempt is to understand such correlation among the angles and distance of the point from the circle through sound and color gradients."

description = "This is a sketch to understand geometry formed by four random points on a canvas. Infinite polygons with four vertex appear on the canvas randomly, one after the other. This is a small attempt to unlearn the common shapes of quadrilaterals drawn in our mathematics textbooks which are mostly convex."

The live video of the observer appears on the canvas while the image shade can be changed by moving mouse cursor (live) over the video while the video image rotates psychedelically leaving traces of its previous frame."

description = "This sketch is to create a naive connection between sound and visualization. The user can use the play/pause button to start/stop the sound, while the slider allows to change the frequency of the sound from 400 to 1200Hz. The speed with which the slider is moved results into different concentric circles. These circles represent the change and sudden jumps in the frequency of the sound."

alt = "Flat Land"
description = "Flat Land - A romance of many Dimensions. This is a book by Edwin Abbott Abbott I found in the philosophy section of Blossom BookHouse at MG road, Bengaluru, India. I made this sketch a little later after I purchased the book but I find glimpses manifested in the sketch from the first 30 pages of the book. Imagine a flat land where lines, squares and other 2-D objects exist, unaware of a higher dimension such as 3-D. What will happen when a Sphere passes through such a Flat Land? What will the line observe while the sphere moves from north pole to its south pole through the flat plane? This sketch attempts the same in a much naive way. It will require the access to your webcam and project your real time video stream to a 3-D cube with a flat plane passing through it."
